<h3>A Recommended list of resources for understanding Kurt's life and work:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      The best way to understand the writer is by reading, especially the widely loved and taught Slaughterhouse Five, Breakfast of Champions, and my personal favorite, Cat's Cradle. Read a few more of his novels, they are often funny, insightful, and espouse secular humanist principles that are simultaneously tender and insightful. They also make excellent companions while traveling via plane, train, boat, or automobile.</li>
      <li>
        His nonfiction writing is well worth your time as well, including the Hunter S. Thompson-esque "A Man Without a Country" and "If This Isn't Nice, What Is?: Advice to The Young", a collection of jokes and insights offered during the numerous college commencement speeches that Vonnegut was invited to provide.</li>
        <li> Lastly, the under-appreciated "Love, as Always, Kurt: Vonnegut as I Knew Him" by Loree Rackstraw, a former student and longtime friend of Kurt who eventually settled in Minneapolis, Minnesota after studying under Kurt at the famous Iowa Writer's Workshop at the University of Iowa. </li>

<blockquote><strong>Here are some of my favorite quotes from one of my all-time favorite books, Galápagos by Kurt Vonnegut:</strong>
<ul>
 <li>“And people still laugh about as much as they ever did, despite their shrunken brains. If a bunch of them are lying around on a beach, and one of them farts, everybody else laughs and laughs, just as people would have done a million years ago.”</li>
  <li> “Just about every adult human being back then had a brain weighing about three kilogrammes! There was no end to the evil schemes that a thought machine that oversized couldn't imagine and execute. 
So I raise this question, although there is nobody around to answer it: Can it be doubted that three-kilogramme brains were once nearly fatal defects in the evolution of the human race?” </li>
  <li> “Why so many of us knocked us major chunks of our brains with alcohol from time to time remains an interesting mystery. It may be that we were tring to give evolution a shove in the right direction - in the direction of smaller brains.” </li>
